# HTTP server with Sockets

A very basic HTTP server using the Python native socket interface

No dependencies needed.

Once you execute **app.py** it will run the server on http://localhost:9000

The **static files** must be stored under the *static/* directory and accessed via **/static/file.ext**

The code is kind of messy right now but I will make it cleaner 🐌🤙
