# HTTP server with Sockets

    A very basic HTTP server using the Python native socket interface.

I built this small project to prove my knowledge on the HTTP communication protocol.

No dependencies required.

Once you execute **app.py** it will run the server on http://localhost:9000

The **static files** must be stored under the *static/* directory and accessed via **/static/file.ext**

> The code is kind of messy right now but I will make it cleaner 🐌🤙
